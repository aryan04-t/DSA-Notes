# What is a Tree?

- A tree is a hierarchical data structure that is non-linear in nature.

---

## Binary Tree:

- Whenever any node in a tree can have at most only 2 children, then that tree is called a "Binary Tree".

---

## N-ary Tree is Also Known As "Generic Tree":

- Any node in this tree can have any number of children.

---

## Some Common Tree Terms:

1. **Node:** 
   - An individual element of a tree data structure, consisting of data and links to its children (if any).

2. **Root:** 
   - A root node is the topmost node in a tree data structure. It is the first node of the tree and has no parent. Every other node in the tree has exactly one parent node, except for the root node, which has no parent. 

3. **Parent:** 
   - A node from which another node is directly descended.

4. **Child:** 
   - A node directly descended from another node.

5. **Ancestor:** 
   - Any node lying in the path from the root to a specific node.

6. **Descendant:** 
   - Any node reachable by traversing down the tree from a specific node.

7. **Sibling:** 
   - Nodes sharing the same parent node.

8. **Leaf:** 
   - A node in a tree that has no children.

9. **Levels of a tree:**
   - The levels of a tree represent the depth or distance of nodes from the root. The root node is at level 0, its children are at level 1, and so on.

## Traversal of Tree:

  (i) **BFS (Breadth First Traversal):** 
  - Level Order Traversal 

 (ii) **DFS (Depth First Traversal):** 
  - Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder Traversal 

(iii) **Morris Traversal**
