# What is a Compiler, and What is an Interpreter: 


* Compliers and interpreters are programs that help convert the high level language (Source Code) into machine codes to be understood by the computers.

@ How does a Compiler Works (Surface Understanding): 

---> A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code all at once.
---> It produces a separate executable file that can be run without the need for the original source code.

* Advantage: 
---> Faster execution: Compiled programs are usually faster since they have already been translated into machine code.

* Disadvantage: 
---> Compilation time: Depending on the size and complexity of the source code, compilation can take a significant amount of time.

@ How does an Interpreter Works (Surface Understanding): 

---> An interpreter reads and executes the code line by line. 
---> It translates the source code into machine code one statement at a time.
---> It runs the program directly without creating a separate executable file.

* Advantage: 
---> Easier for debugging: If there is an error in your code, you can often identify and correct it more easily because the interpreter will stop at the point of the error.

* Disadvantage: 
---> Slower execution: Interpreted programs are generally slower than compiled ones because the code is translated and executed simultaneously.

@ Phases of an Compiler (In Depth Understanding): 


* On surface level if we see, we basically have two phases of compilers, namely the "Analysis Phase" and "Synthesis Phase". 

* The analysis phase creates an intermediate representation from the given source code. 
* The synthesis phase creates an equivalent target program from the intermediate representation. 

---> But these two above phases of compiler can be broken down into even smaller and detailed phases, and those detailed phases are the phases of compiler which we generally refer to when someone asks us about "Phases of Compiler". 

* The process of converting the source code into machine code involves several phases or stages, which are collectively known as the "Phases of a Compiler". The typical phases of a compiler are: 

1. Lexical Analysis: 
   - The first phase of a compiler is lexical analysis, also known as scanning. 
   - This phase reads the source code and breaks it into a stream of tokens, which are the basic units of the programming language. 
   - The tokens are then passed on to the next phase for further processing.

2. Syntax Analysis: 
   - The second phase of a compiler is syntax analysis, also known as parsing. 
   - This phase takes the stream of tokens generated by the lexical analysis phase and checks whether they conform to the grammar of the programming language. 
   - The output of this phase is usually an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). 

3. Semantic Analysis: 
   - The third phase of a compiler is semantic analysis. 
   - This phase checks whether the code is semantically correct, i.e., whether it conforms to the language’s type system and other semantic rules.

4. Intermediate Code Generation: 
   - The fourth phase of a compiler is intermediate code generation. 
   - This phase generates an intermediate representation of the source code that can be easily translated into machine code. 

5. Optimization: 
   - The fifth phase of a compiler is optimization. 
   - This phase applies various optimization techniques to the intermediate code to improve the performance of the generated machine code. 

6. Code Generation: 
   - The final phase of a compiler is code generation. 
   - This phase takes the optimized intermediate code and generates the actual machine code that can be executed by the target hardware. 

7. Error handling:
   - Error handling is a phase of compiler which takes place with all the above phases of compiler.  
   - Error handling phase of compiler involves detecting mistakes in the source code and reporting them to the programmer, and attempting to recover from errors to continue the compilation process. It helps programmers understand and fix issues in their code, ensuring that the generated executable is as error-free as possible.

8. Symbol Table Management: 
   - Just like error handling this is also a phase of compiler which takes place in all the above phases of compiler. 
   - Symbol table is a data structure being used and maintained by the compiler, consisting of all the identifier’s names along with their types.
   - It helps the compiler to function smoothly by finding the identifiers quickly.

@ Phases of an Interpreter (In Depth Understanding): 


The interpreter follows a step-by-step approach for each line in the code. Here's how it works: 

1. Lexical Analysis: 
   - The interpreter reads the current line of code, breaking it down into tokens, and discarding any whitespace or comments on that line.
   - The process of breaking down line of code into tokens is aka as "Tokenization". 
   - Lexical analysis ensures that the individual tokens are correctly identified.

2. Syntax Analysis (Parsing): 
   - The interpreter then parses the tokens of the current line to determine if they form a valid syntax tree according to the language's grammar rules.
   - If the syntax is incorrect for that line, a syntax error is reported, and the execution of that line is halted.

3. Semantic Analysis: 
   - If the line of code passes the syntax analysis, the interpreter performs semantic analysis for that line. It checks for any semantic errors specific to that line, such as type mismatches or undeclared variables.
   - If semantic errors are found, they are reported, and execution for that line is stopped.

4. Execution: 
   - If the current line of code successfully passes all the previous phases (lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis), the interpreter executes that line.
   - It may update variables, call functions, or perform other relevant actions as specified by that line of code.
   - Throughout the execution of the program, the interpreter continuously checks for runtime errors, such as division by zero, array index out of bounds, and other exceptional conditions.
   - If a runtime error occurs, the interpreter must handle it appropriately. This may involve reporting the error to the user and potentially halting the execution of the program.

5. Error Handling: 
   - This a phase of interpreter which takes place with all the above mentioned 4 phases of interpreter, this phase is even described in the end of above all 4 phases.  
   - The error handling phase is responsible for dealing with errors, which could include providing detailed error messages and stack traces to aid in debugging.

6. Symbol Table Management: 
   - Symbol table management is also a phase of interpreter which takes place with all the 1st four phases of interpreter. 
   - The symbol table is a data structure used by interpreters to keep track of various program entities such as variables, functions, their types, and their scope. 
   - Symbol table helps the interpreter maintain the state of the program. 
   - During interpretation, as the interpreter encounters declarations, assignments, and references to variables or functions, it updates the symbol table with relevant information.
   - Symbol table management is crucial for ensuring variables are correctly scoped, types are consistent, and functions can be properly called.

7. Move to the Next Line: 
   - After executing the current line, the interpreter proceeds to the next line in the code.
   - The entire process, including lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis, is repeated for the new line.

8. Termination: 
   - The termination phase occurs when the interpreter reaches the end of the program or encounters an unrecoverable error.
   - If the program execution is completed without any critical errors, the interpreter exits, and the program terminates normally.
   - In the case of a severe error which cannot be recovered, the interpreter reports the error and then terminates the program.
   - Additionally, the interpreter might release any allocated resources and perform cleanup operations before termination.

In summary, the interpreter moves through these above phases sequentially, analyzing and executing one line of code at a time. It manages a symbol table to keep track of program entities, handles errors, and terminates when it reaches the end of the program or encounters a fatal error. This step-by-step approach is a fundamental characteristic of interpreters, allowing for real-time feedback and error reporting.

# What is an Assembler: 


* An Assembler is used to translate the program written in Assembly language into machine code. 
* The source program is an input of an assembler that contains assembly language instructions. 
* The output generated by the assembler is the object code or machine code understandable by the computer.

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _


@ How does an Assembler Works (Surface Understanding): 

---> An assembler does not execute code line by line like an interpreter. 
---> Instead, it translates the entire assembly language source code into machine code all at once, similar to how a compiler operates. 
---> But it does not create an executable file that you can run directly, it generates a binary file containing the machine code. 
---> This binary file can then be loaded into memory and executed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU).

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _


@ Phases of an Assembler (In Depth Understanding): 

* An assembler typically has 2 main phases: the "First Pass" and the "Second Pass". 
* These 2 phases of an assembler are used to convert assembly language code into machine code, which can be executed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). 

1. First Pass aka "Analysis Phase": 
   - Scanning/Parsing: In the first pass, the assembler reads through the entire assembly language program, line by line, and breaks it down into smaller components, such as labels, opcodes, operands, and comments.
   - Symbol Table Creation: As the first pass progresses, the assembler creates a symbol table to keep track of all labels and their associated memory addresses. This table is crucial for resolving symbolic references in the code.
   - Error Checking: During this phase, the assembler also performs error checking to ensure that the assembly code is correctly formatted and that labels and instructions are used appropriately.

2. Second Pass aka "Synthesis Phase": 
   - Code Generation: In the second pass, the assembler uses the information gathered during the first pass, such as the symbol table, to generate the actual machine code instructions. It replaces symbolic references with their corresponding memory addresses and assembles the binary code. 
   - Output Generation: The assembled machine code is typically written to an output file or memory, ready for execution by the computer's CPU. 

These two phases work together to convert human-readable assembly language into machine code, which the computer can understand and execute. The first pass focuses on analysis and preparing the necessary data structures, while the second pass handles the actual code generation and output.
