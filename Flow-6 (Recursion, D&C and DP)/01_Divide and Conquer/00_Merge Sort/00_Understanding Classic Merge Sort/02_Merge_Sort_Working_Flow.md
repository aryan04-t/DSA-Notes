# Merge Sort Working Flow: 

> 1. Divide the array into halves recursively until each half has one element. 
> 2. Conquer by merging the sorted halves back together. 
> 3. Merge Sort takes advantage of the fact that a single element is always sorted. It repeatedly merges sorted subarrays to produce a larger sorted array. This merging process ensures that as elements are combined, they maintain their sorted order.
